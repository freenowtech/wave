# Versioning Policy

Predictable and consistent versions for Wave

## Semantic Versioning

Our goal is to release update to this library without breaking anyone's projects. Therefore, we are using [SemVer](https://semver.org)
which has the following release types.

-   **Major** versions contain breaking changes and may also contain sweeping visual changes, like changing colors (usually includes a codemods).
-   **Minor** versions include new components or functionality and properties for existing components.
-   **Patch** versions provide internal fixes, documentation changes or package upgrades (anything that does not affect the consumers of this library).

### Deprecations

When deciding on the deprecation of a feature or component in the next major version, we add a warning indicating
the feature is scheduled for deprecation or removal. This is sent to the console in development builds and excluded in
production builds.
