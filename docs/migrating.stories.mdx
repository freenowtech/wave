# Migrating

Migrating from one major version to the next with ease.

## From v1 to v2

A codemod exists to upgrade your components for this version.

```bash
npx jscodeshift -t node_modules/@freenow/wave/codemods/v2.ts path/to/src
```

### Button and TextButton

The `block` property used to act as a shortcut to give the button components a width of 100%. In the future, use the `width` property
directly. It uses the styled-system variable, which is a lot more flexible than just the boolean flag.

## Codemods

Codemods are scripted transformations that you can run on your code to take care of most of the repetitive work involved
in upgrading from one major version to the next. The codemod instructions for each major release assume that your code
has already been upgraded to the previous major release. If this is not the case, you should run the codemods for all
previous major versions first. Beware that codemods are not 100% fool-proof and may break your code.

If you're working in a typescript environment, you need to add `--parser=tsx` to the command in each codemod command to
allow jscodeshift to parse your typescript/jsx files.
