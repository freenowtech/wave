### Documentation

#### 📖 New documentation

The documentation is now generated by [docz v2](https://www.docz.site/) and
is powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). Apart from the updated
appearance, we will focus on continually updating the design and content of the
documentation as part of an ongoing effort to improve the documentation
experience.

The main advantages of the new site are:
- Better theming ability, which allows us to use Wave for building documentation pages
- Better performance and ~90% reduction in bundle size (this was the main issue with the old site)

Unfortunately to achieve this we had to disable the auto generated component
prop documentation. This means that component props are undocumented for now.
