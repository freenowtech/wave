# Browser support

Creating a consistent experience across browsers and devices.

## Supported Devices

The design system should be universally accessible. Components might not look perfect in all scenarios, but everything
should still be accessible to the user.

**Currently, we are supporting the latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.**
