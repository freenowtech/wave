# Dimming

The Dimming is a dark blue transparent layer covering 100% of the screen’s width and height. It’s a building block to
compose and emphasize a screen overlay. Here you will see it contained in a small box for demo purposes.

<ItemWrapper>
    <DimmingFixedDimensions />
</ItemWrapper>

### Usage

```jsx
<Dimming />
```
