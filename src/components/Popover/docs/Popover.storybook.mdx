## Usage

### Popover Trigger & Content

Popover components consist of 2 main elements:

-   **Popover Trigger** – an element that shows/hides the Popover.
-   **Popover Content** – card with content that is toggled by the Trigger.

For **Trigger** you can use just a plain string (for default variant), or following components from Wave:

-   **&lt;Text&gt;**
-   **&lt;Button&gt;**
-   **&lt;Button&gt; with Icon**
-   **&lt;Icon&gt;**
-   **&lt;Link&gt;**

The **Popover Content** acts as a container for any content: text, form, or anything else...

### Difference from a Tooltip component

-   Popover is toggled by clicking on (not hovering over) the Trigger. The second click (or click outside the Popover) hides the Popover.
-   Popover scrolls with the page
-   Popover content and trigger are not limited to text.

### Style Props

The Popover supports:

-   **placement** prop for specifying the Popover content attachment in relation to the Popover trigger
-   **offset** prop for the margin between Trigger and Popover card.
