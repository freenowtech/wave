# Toggle

Toggle is a control that is used to quickly switch between two possible states. Toggles are only used for these binary
actions that occur immediately after the user “flips” the toggle switch. They are commonly used for “on/off” switches.

<ItemWrapper gridTemplate="auto auto auto auto 1fr">
    <Toggle defaultChecked />
    <Toggle />
    <Toggle error defaultChecked />
    <Toggle disabled />
</ItemWrapper>

## Behaviour

-   Use toggle to swap the state of a functionality or preference (usually between „on“ and „off“)
-   For multi-state scenarios consider radio buttons or checkboxes
-   Toggles should take affect automatically (without saving)

## Technical Information

Inside the toggle component is a checkbox and therefore the api and usage works similarly. For example, instead
of passing the `value` prop, the `checked` prop must be used instead.
