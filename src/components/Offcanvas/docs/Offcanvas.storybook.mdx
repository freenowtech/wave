# Offcanvas

The Offcanvas should only contain content or flows which are related to the current page and not replace pages, therefore
its complexity level has to be simple. Consider the fullscreen state if you want to focus the users attention to the Offcanvas
content.

Offcanvas is responsive per default but the width can be adjusted (the default is 600px or 37.5rem). Content on the Offcanvas
is scrollable and has a space5 bounding box.

<Primary />

## Usage

### Basic use

```jsx
const [showOffcanvas, setShowOffcanvas] = useState(true);

<Offcanvas onClose={() => setShowOffcanvas(false)} fullscreen={true}>
    {dismiss => (
        <>
            <Headline as="h2">Add Note</Headline>
            <Text as="p" my={3}>
                Ensure that all participants are aware of the change.
            </Text>
            <Button onClick={dismiss}>Add Note</Button>
            <TextButton onClick={dismiss}>Cancel</TextButton>
        </>
    )}
</Offcanvas>;
```

### Dismissing the Offcanvas

Offcanvas provides a function to dismiss the component with an animation. The
dismiss function is available either through render props or a hook. After the
animation has finished the `onClose` callback will be called.

#### Via Render Props

Pass render function as a child to `Offcanvas`. Call the function passed as an argument to close the Offcanvas:

```jsx
<Offcanvas>{dismiss => <Button onClick={dismiss}>Close</Button>}</Offcanvas>
```

#### Via Hook

Use the `useOffcanvasDismiss` hook to get the dismiss function. It is only available inside the `Offcanvas` component because
it uses React context to get the dismiss function.

```jsx
const InsideOffcanvas = () => {
    const dismiss = useOffcanvasDismiss();
    return <button onClick={dismiss}>Close</button>;
};

const OffcanvasWrapper = () => (
    <Offcanvas>
        <InsideOffcanvas />
    </Offcanvas>
);
```

<Stories includePrimary={false} />
