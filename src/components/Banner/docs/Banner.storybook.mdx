# Banner

Banner is a strong visual pattern that is used to display important information or state which remains until the
cause is resolved or the banner is dismissed by the user.

-   Banner can include any kind of content, i.e. icons, links, copy
-   Banner should be dismissible
-   Banner **info** and **success** appear at the bottom of the screen (sticky)
-   Banner **error** appears at the top of the screen (sticky)
-   Banner appears and disappears via slide in/out animation combined with soft fade and smooth easing

To properly hide the banner with the correct animation, it is recommended to call the dismiss function that can be used
when providing a function as the child. This will also unmount the component once the animation is completed.

If you need the banner to be placed top or bottom without depending on the variant make sure to align with the design team
and bear in mind that you can use the **position** prop for it.

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={BannerStories.Default} />

<Advice>
    <Unstyled>
    The `Banner` uses `position:sticky` for positioning. It means it will always be rendered on top/bottom of the
    viewport ([MDN](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position)).

## Visibility management (dismiss function)

Banner provides a function to dismiss the component with an animation.
The dismiss function is available either through render props or a hook.
After the animation has finished the onClose callback will be called.

<Story of={BannerStories.WithDismissedFn} />

```tsx
<Banner>
    {dismiss => (
        <>
            <Text inverted>If you are tired of this banner, hit the button ðŸ‘‰ </Text>
            <Button onClick={dismiss}>Close</Button>
        </>
    )}
</Banner>
```

<Stories includePrimary={false} />
