# Checkbox

Checkboxes are used for a list of options where the user may select multiple options, including all or none. A
stand-alone checkbox is used for a single option that the user can turn on or off.

You can provide the label as either a `string` or as a React component. If a `string` is provided as the label, it
will be wrapped with the [Text](/components/Text) component.
