# FilePicker

This component delivers an optimal user experience by utilizing core web technologies. It uses the [HTML filepicker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) for a lightweight and efficient approach to file uploading.

<Primary />

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={FilePickerStories} />

<StyledSystemLinks component="FilePicker" supportedProps={['margin']} />

## Appearance

-   **File title**: This provides a clear description of what the user should upload. If long, takes as many lines as needed extending the height of the component.
-   **Button label**: Describes the main action, it works better when short

## Placement

-   They are mainly used in forms but can also appear in other places as a standalone component. In either case, prefer to have them inside `<form>` tag for better user experience.
-   Place `Filepicker` with a minimum of 8px _("Spaces" value 1 for our default spaces values)_ margin on each side.

## Behaviour

-   The user may only select 1 file at a time.
-   By default, any file format is accepted, but you can add `accept` property to validate a specific file format.
-   Click on "Browse" button triggers a browser-specific upload window.
-   Once the user selects the file, the browser-specific select window closes and the files will appear below the File title label.

## Usage

### Showing errors

Below you have an example of how you can show an error using the [`HelperText` component](?path=/docs/components-helpertext--docs).
Submit any file to trigger the error and clean the input by canceling the selection to remove the error state.

<ControlledErrorFilePicker />

```tsx
const UploadAvatar = () => {
    const [error, setError] = useState<string>();

    return (
        <Box>
            <FilePicker
                buttonText="Browse files"
                label="A picture of you"
                name="avatar"
                error={error}
                onFileChange={eventFile => {
                    try {
                        setError(undefined);
                        // here we make something that can throw
                    } catch (error) {
                        setError(error.message);
                    }
                }}
            />
            {error && (
                <HelperText mt={1} variant="danger">
                    {error}
                </HelperText>
            )}
        </Box>
    );
};
```
