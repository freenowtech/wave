# FilePicker

This component it’s a trigger opening the native file uploader.
This component uses default Web input type file check [Mozilla Input Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file)
if you need to know more about the supported attributes and values

## Appearance
- **File title**: This provides a clear description of what the user should upload. If long, takes as many lines as needed extending the height of the component.
- **Button label**: Describes the main action, it works better when short
- It is recommended to place this component together with a helper text to provide additional help for what's expected. Helper text should only appear if the user open the file explorer and doesn't select anything.

## Placement

- They are mainly used in forms but can also appear in other places as a stand alone component, like item or user registration screens.
- It should be placed with a minimum of 8px _("Spaces" value 1 for our default spaces values)_ margin on each side
- It should be placed vertically aligned

## Behaviour

- The user may select 1 file at a time.
- By default, any file format is accepted, but you can add parameters to validate a specific file format.
- The action of clicking Browse file will trigger a browser-specific upload window.
- Once the user selects the file, the browser-specific select window closes and the files will appear below the File title label.

### Error
Below you have an example of how you can properly show an error using the **HelperText**. You can try to submit any file to trigger the error
and clean the input by canceling the selection to remove the error state.

## Playground
The example below will demostrate how to create compositions of `FilePicker`

<Playground>
  <Box maxWidth="100%" width="30rem" mx="auto" p={2}>
    <FilePicker
      accept="image/png, image/jpeg"
      buttonText="Browse files"
      label="A picture of you"
      name="avatar"
      onChange={(e) => console.log('onChange', e)}
      onFileChange={(file, e) => console.log('onFileChange', file, e)}
    />
    <FilePicker
      accept="image/png, image/jpeg"
      buttonText="Browse files"
      label="A logo you like"
      name="logo"
      onChange={(e) => console.log('onChange', e)}
      onFileChange={(file, e) => console.log('onFileChange', file, e)}
      mt={1}
    />
    <FilePicker
      accept="image/png, image/jpeg"
      buttonText="Browse files"
      label="This provides a clear description of what the user should upload. Can be multiline"
      name="logo"
      onChange={(e) => console.log('onChange', e)}
      onFileChange={(file, e) => console.log('onFileChange', file, e)}
      mt={1}
    />
  </Box>
</Playground>

In the real world you may need to deal with the `FilePicker` within a form that will handle the submission of the file. Below you will find a snippet
that can help as example.

**Tip:** The `FilePicker` exposes an additional callback of `onFileChange` which signature is `(file, event)`. The [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/File)
and the standard input event. This is a convenient to use `file` instead of `e.target.elements.avatar.files[0]` check the console while using the example below.

<Playground>
  <Box maxWidth="100%" width="30rem" mx="auto">
    <form onSubmit={(e) => {
      alert(`
        About to submit ${e.target.elements.avatar.value}.
        Check console to see the value provided by the Web File API.
        more at https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/File
      `)
      console.log(e.target.elements.avatar.files[0])
      e.preventDefault()
    }}>
      <Box mb={2}>
        <FilePicker
          accept="image/png, image/jpeg"
          buttonText="Browse files"
          label="A picture of you"
          name="avatar"
          onChange={(e) => console.log('onChange', e)}
          onFileChange={(file, e) => console.log('onFileChange', file, e)}
        />
      </Box>
      <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
    </form>
  </Box>
</Playground>
