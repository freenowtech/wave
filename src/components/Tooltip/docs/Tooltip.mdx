# Tooltip

This component provides informative text to an UI element.

<SimpleTooltipExample />

```jsx
<Tooltip content="This is a regular tooltip 🏓">
    <div>target</div>
</Tooltip>
```

## Usage

Use the tooltip for user on-boarding, guiding information about a new feature, detailed interactive workflows or for a contextual help (eg. over a button).

## Appearance

-   The font size is 12px and font weight is regular.
-   Top and bottom padding around the text area is 4px and 8px for right and left.
-   The max-width for the tooltip is 300px in desktop and 160px on mobile devices.
-   The copy should be instructional and concise. Max 200 characters are allowed.
-   Emojis are allowed to be used 😇

## Behavior

-   The tooltip is accessible on hover or on tap (mobile) and should be automatically dismissed when the user stops hovering
    the target area (or taps somewhere else on mobile devices)
-   The tooltip should be eased-out.
-   **Don’ts:** don't change the shape of the tooltip (rounded corners, etc), don’t crop it, don’t hide the element it hovers over

## Placement

It is possible to adjust the position of the tooltip connection to the target with the `placement` prop. Below is a list
of possible options which are represented in the square next to it. It is important to keep in mind that the tooltip
will be moved to a different position if it cannot be shown on the desired side due to screen sizes. Read more about the
Tether library [here](http://tether.io).

## Playground

<Playground>
    <Tooltip content="Tooltip Content!">
        <span>Target</span>
    </Tooltip>
</Playground>

## Technical Usage

For the Tooltip to work properly, it needs to have a single child component to bind the mouse-enter and -leave events to.
The library `react-tether` which is used internally works with setting a `ref` to the child. To avoid complications, make
sure the child component supports the `ref` property.

```jsx
const CustomComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
    <div {...props}>
        <button ref={ref}>Hover to show tooltip</button>
    </div>
));

const WithTooltip = () => (
    <Tooltip content="Information about your feature">
        <CustomComponent />
    </Tooltip>
)
```
