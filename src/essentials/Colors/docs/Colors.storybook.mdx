# Colors

Wave has a set of colors that are used throughout the design system. HSL model is used to define colors.

The exact set of colors depend on the theme that is used. Two themes provided as a part of the library:

-   `classic` - the default theme with primary blue color;
-   `modern` - the redesigned theme with maroon primary color.

Each theme provides a set of CSS variables used to style components. They are divided into two tiers:

-   _bare colors_ - matching color names provided by the theme. this tier is theme-specific and changes when the theme changes;
-   _semantic colors_ - color names that convey semantic meaning, e.g. `foreground-primary`. This tier is theme-agnostic and does not change when the theme changes.

You can create you own theme by creating a set of semantic CSS variables with predefined names.

## Semantic Colors

Semantic color tokens represent not just a color value but also a semantic role it's used for.
In Wave, most color tokens belong to one of three roles: _foreground_, _background_, and _border_.
By assigning semantic roles to colors, we achieve predictable theming and dark mode support.

You can build your custom components using the semantic color tokens, and they will automatically support theming and dark mode.
Prefer to use them for your app.

Every color token follows the naming convention:

-   design system prefix for semantic colors `wave-s`;
-   semantic role `foreground`, `background-surface`, `background-element`, or `border`;
-   color name `primary`, `neutral`, `info`, `accent`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `disabled`;
-   optional modifier `default`, `faded` or `highlighted`.

Use `getSemanticValue` function to reduce boilerplate when using semantic colors in your components:

```ts
const BeautifulParagraph = styled.p`
    background-color: ${getSemanticValue('background-surface-primary-default')};
    color: ${getSemanticValue('foreground-on-background-primary')};
`;
```

<CssVariablesTable tokens={SemanticColors} tier="s" />

## Bare Colors

Bare color tokens are static and not themeable. They are used to define semantic colors and should not be used directly in your components.

We provide CSS variables for bare colors as an **escape hatch** for cases when you need to use a color that is not covered by semantic colors.
Please, report such cases to us, so we can add the missing semantic color.

Bare color tokens aren't accessible via `getSemanticValue` function. Read the CSS variable directly, they have `--wave-b-` prefix, followed by the color name:

```ts
const BeautifulParagraph = styled.p`
    color: var('--wave-b-red-900')};
`;
```

<CssVariablesTable tokens={Colors} tier="b" />

## HSL variables (`-hsl`)

Wave stores HSL color values in semantic tokens. It becomes a challenge to apply opacity to a color, without making the whole component transparent.
That's why together with semantic tokens, we expose HSL channels as separate variables. They follow the same convention as semantic tokens, but ends with the `-hsl` suffix:

For example, `background-surface-primary-default` stores `hsl(210, 100%, 50%)`, but `background-surface-primary-default-hsl` stores `210, 100%, 50%`

Use them, when you need an alpha channel:

```ts
const BeautifulParagraph = styled.p`
    background-color: hsla(${getSemanticValue('background-surface-primary-default-hsl')}, 0.5);
`;
```
