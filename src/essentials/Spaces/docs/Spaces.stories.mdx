# Spaces

All spacing (margins and paddings) for components and typography are **multiples of 8px** (i.e. 0.5rem).
Whenever possible, make sure that objects line up, both vertically and horizontally.
By building your product you are free to define your spaces from the following scale by
keeping in mind the following guidelines:

-   Avoid choosing spaces outside the scale
-   Keep space consistency in your product
-   The distance of elements has to reflect their hierarchically relation
-   Chose small distances for close relation (e.g. checkbox to label) and large distances for distant relations (e.g. Header to Intro).
